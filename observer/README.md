# Observer

Design Pattern: Observer

Also known as: Listener, Event-Subscriber

## Essentials

Let's say you have one object. And sometimes, some events happen to it.

How to track down that events and notify multiple other objects about them?

The answer is observer.

Basically, it allows us to define a subscription mechanism to spy on the specific object and all of the events that happening to it.
